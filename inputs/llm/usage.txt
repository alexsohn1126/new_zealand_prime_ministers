I have a tibble with 4 columns: Name (for each New Zealnd PM), born (which year they were born), died (which year they died) , and years_lived (died - born). I have 2 tibbles that both have these columns, but containing different data. I want to make a single tibble with 2 tibble's worth of data combined. How do I do this?

You can use the bind_rows() function from the dplyr package in R to combine two tibbles vertically. Here's an example assuming your tibbles are named tibble1 and tibble2:

R

library(dplyr)

# Assuming tibble1 and tibble2 are your two tibbles
combined_tibble <- bind_rows(tibble1, tibble2)

# If the columns are not in the same order in both tibbles, you can use select() to reorder them
# combined_tibble <- combined_tibble %>% select(Name, born, died, years_lived)

This will create a new tibble, combined_tibble, by stacking the rows of tibble1 on top of the rows of tibble2.

Make sure you have the dplyr package installed and loaded before running this code. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using install.packages("dplyr").

What if I want to remove duplicate rows that occur in the final table?

If you want to remove duplicate rows based on all columns in the combined tibble, you can use the distinct() function from the dplyr package. Here's how you can modify the previous code:

R

library(dplyr)

# Assuming tibble1 and tibble2 are your two tibbles
combined_tibble <- bind_rows(tibble1, tibble2) %>%
                   distinct()

# If the columns are not in the same order in both tibbles, you can use select() to reorder them
# combined_tibble <- combined_tibble %>% select(Name, born, died, years_lived)

The distinct() function removes duplicate rows based on all columns in the tibble, keeping only the first occurrence. If you want to remove duplicates based on specific columns, you can pass those column names to the distinct() function:

R

combined_tibble <- bind_rows(tibble1, tibble2) %>%
                   distinct(Name, born, died, years_lived)

Adjust the column names based on your actual tibble structure and the columns you want to consider for identifying duplicates.
